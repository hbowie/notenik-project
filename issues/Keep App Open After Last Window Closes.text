Title:  Keep App Open After Last Window Closes

Status: 6 - Completed

Seq:    19

Date:   8 Jan 2020

Reported By: Jonathan C.

Release: 4.6.0

Issue: 

When I close the last open collection the app closes. I guess I'm using Notenik unusually at the moment, but this is a little frustrating. Most apps have an option about this.


Body: 

Due to be resolved with the next release.
