Reported By: Warwick L

Issue: 

I started playing with tasks. In the process I ended up with plenty of superfluous tags that couldnâ€™t be deleted. 

Body: 

Modified the Favorites to HTML export to suppress empty tags. Implemented in 2.2.0. 

Can also be addressed by using the Reload Collection command.
