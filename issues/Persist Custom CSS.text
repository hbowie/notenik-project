Title:  Persist Custom CSS

Status: 6 - Completed

Seq:    41

Date:   07 Dec 2020

Reported By: `Isaa

Release: 5.0.0

Issue: 

Whenever I go to make a change to the CSS, the text area reverts to the application defaults, removing my changes. I would like to ask that user changes to the CSS persist upon modification.


Body: 

Should be fixed in release 5.0.0.
