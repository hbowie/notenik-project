Issue: 

Is there a callback-url implemented for notenik?

I am new to scripting and wanted to take a look at integrating Notenik with Hook.

I was looking at [hookproductivity.com/help/integration/creating-integration-scripts](https://hookproductivity.com/help/integration/creating-integration-scripts) and noticed that Hook documentation mentioned callback-urls.
