Issue: 

I'm trying to understand the motivation of the note display always showing the (present or imputed) "Body:" tag at the end of the header? It seems to take up unnecessary space.  Is there are way of customising what metadata is displayed and how?  (It's not jumping out at me from the docs if it is there.)
