Title:  Allow User to Change the Preferred File Extension

Status: 9 - Closed

Seq:    31

Date:   17 Jan 2020

Reported By: Jonathan C.

Release: 2.9.0

Issue: 

I've checked two Collections Preferences and both were set to txt Preferred File Extension. On both I set to md, and pressed save, but when re-opening the Preferences it was set back to txt. 


Body: 

Changes in the preferred file extension are now captured and saved (although file extensions for existing Notes are not modified).
