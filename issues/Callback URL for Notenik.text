Issue: 

Is there a callback-url implemented for notenik?

I am new to scripting and wanted to take a look at integrating Notenik with Hook.

I was looking at [hookproductivity.com/help/integration/creating-integration-scripts](https://hookproductivity.com/help/integration/creating-integration-scripts) and noticed that Hook documentation mentioned callback-urls.


Body: 

See [URL Routing on macOS](https://medium.com/@floschliep/url-routing-on-macos-c53a06f0a984) for some clues. 

Also see [Defining a Custom URL Scheme for Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/defining_a_custom_url_scheme_for_your_app).
