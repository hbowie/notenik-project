Title:  Make Edit View Scrollable

Status: 9 - Closed

Seq:    13

Date:   08 Dec 2019

Reported By: MacOSX Guru

Release: 2.8.0

Issue: 

I opened a folder containing all my notes and wanted to make a new note. This is what I got. Also, it wasn't scrollable. I couldn't go down to find the body element of the window.


Body: 

The entire Edit view should be scrollable in the 2.8.0 release.
