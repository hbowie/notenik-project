Title:  Changes to Collection Preferences Menu

Status: 6 - Completed

Seq:    29

Date:   18 Jan 2020

Reported By: Jonathan C.

Release: 2.9.0

Issue: 

In the Collection menu, I suggest it should be "Preferences…" not just "Preferences", and why not have a keyboard shortcut like ↑⌘ ?


Body: 

Implemented in 2.9.0. ⌘; assigned as keyboard shortcut.
