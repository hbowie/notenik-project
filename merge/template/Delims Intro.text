Title:  Delims Intro

Seq:    2

Heading: Delimiters

Type:   md

Body: 

Notenik will recognize either of two sets of command and variable delimiters automatically. The choice of delimiters will be triggered by the first command-beginning delimiters encountered. The new delimiters are generally recommended, since they are more likely to be treated kindly by various HTML editors when creating your template files.
