Title:  Markdown to HTML

Seq:    O

Body: 

The letter "O" will cause the field to be treated as Markdown, and converted to HTML.

Following this letter with a minus sign ('-') will cause any opening and closing paragraph tags ('\<p\>' and '\</p\>' respectively) to be stripped from the resulting field (thus reducing the chance for possible conflicts with other tags).
