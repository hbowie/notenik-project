Title:  output

Seq:    3

Body:   This command names and opens the output file, where the results of the template merge will be stored. The single operand is the name of the output file. This command would normally be the first line in your template file. Subsequent template records will be written to the output file. 

Note, however, that the filename can contain a variable name. In this case, the output command would follow the nextrec command, and a new output file would be opened for each row input.
