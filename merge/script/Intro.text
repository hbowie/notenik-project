Body: 

This specification describes the contents of a script file, used for executing a series of commands to transform input data sources and templates into appropriate output. 

The file extension for a script file should be '.tcz', short for 'TDF Czar', which was a predecessor to PSTextMerge, which was in turn a prececessor to Notenik. 

A script file is a text file formatted into five columns, using either tabs or commas as delimiters to separate the columns. 

Blank lines, as well as lines beginning with '<!â€” ', will be ignored.
