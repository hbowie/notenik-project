Body: 

When Notes are stored locally, each Note is stored as its own text file in the UTF-8 format, and a Collection of Notes is stored as a folder full of text files. 

Any of the following file extensions may be used for the Note files.

* .markdown
* .md
* .mdown
* .mdtext
* .mkdown
* .nnk
* .notenik
* .text
* .txt

The two preferred extensions are '.txt' (short for text) and '.md' (short for markdown).

The file name for each Note file will be identical to, or very similar to, the Noteâ€™s title. 

The contents of a Note file will consists of a series of fields, with each field consisting of a field label, a colon, one or more spaces, and finally the field value.
