When Notes are stored locally, each Note is stored as its own text file in the UTF-8 format, and a Collection of Notes is stored as a folder full of text files. 

Any of the following file extensions may be used for the Note files.

* .markdown
* .md
* .mdown
* .mdtext
* .mkdown
* .nnk
* .notenik

The two preferred extensions are '.txt' (short for text) and '.md' (short for markdown).
