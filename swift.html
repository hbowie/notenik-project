<h2 id="introduction-to-notenik">Introduction to Notenik</h2>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m <a href="https://herbbowie.com">Herb Bowie</a>, and I&rsquo;m responsible for the concepts and code behind <a href="https://notenik.net">Notenik</a>, a simple but powerful system for taking, collecting and referencing notes. On the following pages I&rsquo;ll provide a gradual introduction to the version of <a href="http://notenik.net">Notenik</a> written in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a> specifically for <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/">macOS</a>.</p>

<h2 id="motivations">Motivations</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start off by explaining my primary motivations behind the creation of Notenik.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I love notes. I like being able to write down some words &ndash; a few or a bunch &ndash; about something that interests me and then refer back to them later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like the simplicity and flexibility of notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to store my notes in an open, non-proprietary format that I can easily write, read and understand, but also in a format that can be usefully manipulated by a number of software tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want my notes to be portable. I want to be able to easily move them around from one device to another, from one platform to another, without losing anything in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want my notes to be durable. I don&rsquo;t want to have to worry about  being unable to read them a few years down the road because some piece of software is no longer available or some &ldquo;free&rdquo; service has gone out of business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want some basic application software for working with my notes to be open-source and available on as many platforms as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to be able to organize my notes in a variety of useful ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to be able to usefully extend this basic idea of a note in as many ways as possible, while still remaining true to all of my motivations above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want a simple, sturdy user interface that I can apply to as much stuff as possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing these motivations upfront because, if these same ideas appeal to you, then there&rsquo;s a good chance it will be worth your while to read a bit further. On the other hand, if you have different sorts of interests, then it&rsquo;s probably best to just stop now and go about your business.</p>
<h2 id="the-notenik-application">The Notenik Application</h2>
<p>This version of Notenik is written in <a href="https://swift.org">Swift</a> using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode IDE</a>. Source can be found on <a href="https://github.com/hbowie/notenik-swift">GitHub</a>. The executable application can be found on the Mac App Store.
From this point on, I&rsquo;ll introduce one concept at a time.</p>
<h2 id="help-using-notenik">Help Using Notenik</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re already reading this intro, so obviously I don&rsquo;t need to tell you how to find this.
But here&rsquo;s a few other help items that are available, including some that may not be so obvious.</p>
<p>This User Guide is available as a web page from the <a href="http://www.notenik.net">Notenik</a> site, from the <a href="http://www.powersurgepub.com">PowerSurge Publishing</a> site, and from the Notenik Help Menu.</p>
<p>But the same content is also available as a Collection of Help Notes, by selecting the corresponding Open Command from Notenik&rsquo;s Help menu. You may find it a little easier to read and navigate in this form, plus you can practice using Notenik as you read the Intro!</p>
<h2 id="each-note-has-a-title-and-a-body">Each Note has a Title and a Body</h2>
<p>In its most basic form, a Note consists of a Title and a Body.</p>
<p>A Title consists of a few words telling you what the Note is about.</p>
<p>The Body consists of the text of the Note, containing as many words as you like.</p>
<p>If no Title is specified within a Note file, then the file name (without the extension) will be used as the Title of the Note.</p>
<h2 id="each-note-is-its-own-text-file">Each Note is its own Text File</h2>
<p>Each Note is stored as a separate text file, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> format, capable of being read and modified by any text editor, on almost any computer system in the world.</p>
<p>The file name is generally identical to the Note&rsquo;s title, with the exception of a few occasional tweaks to avoid running afoul of various common operating system limitations.</p>
<p>Any of the following file extensions may be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>.markdown</li>
<li>.md</li>
<li>.mdown</li>
<li>.mdtext</li>
<li>.mkdown</li>
<li>.nnk</li>
<li>.notenik</li>
<li>.text</li>
<li>.txt</li>
</ul>
<p>The two preferred extensions are &lsquo;.txt&rsquo; (short for text) and &lsquo;.md&rsquo; (short for markdown &ndash; more on this later).</p>
<p>Use the Text Edit Note command under the Note menu to open the currently displayed Note in your default text editor.</p>
<h2 id="notes-are-collected-into-folders">Notes are Collected into Folders</h2>
<p>Each Note is part of a Collection, and each Collection is stored in its own folder (aka directory). Each Note within a Collection must have its own unique Title.</p>
<p>You can organize your Notes into as many Collections as you would like, and store each Collection wherever you would like.</p>
<p>The Notenik application can open multiple Collections at a time, each in its own window. The Open Recent command under the File menu provides easy access to recently opened Collections.</p>
<p>You may use a command under the File menu to designate the current Collection as your Essential Collection. Once identified, this will be the first Collection opened each time the application launches.</p>
<p>The Save As command under the File menu allows you to save an entire Collection in a new location, with the option to either keep the current location (effectively making a copy) or to delete it (effectively moving the Collection to a new location).</p>
<p>You might want to use the New command on the File menu to create your first Collection now, if you don&rsquo;t already have one created.</p>
<h2 id="add-delete-and-update-your-notes">Add, Delete and Update Your Notes</h2>
<p>The Display tab shows you what your Note looks like. Your note is formatted as a web page, and displayed within Notenik using a built-in web browser. If you click on a hyperlink within the display, then the linked page will replace your Note. If you wish to get back to your Note, then click on the Refresh button in the Toolbar. If your Note has a Link value, then click on the Launch Link button in the Toolbar to see the linked page within your default web browser, instead of Notenik&rsquo;s internal browser.
The Edit tab lets you make changes to the Field Values of a Note.</p>
<p>Use the &lsquo;+&rsquo; (plus) sign on the Toolbar to clear the Field Values and prepare to Add a new Note.</p>
<p>Use the &lsquo;-&rsquo; (minus) sign on the Toolbar to delete the currently selected Note.</p>
<p>Click on the OK button on the Toolbar, or click on the Display tab, to complete and save your latest entries on the Edit tab.</p>
<p>The Note Menu also has equivalent commands, with keyboard shortcuts, to add a New Note or Delete a Note.</p>
<p>You can alter the typeface and font size used on the Display tab by selecting the Display Appearance item under the Format menu, or by clicking on the Display Fonts button on the toolbar. You may then pick a typeface and font from the displayed dropdown menus or, if you&rsquo;d like, enter the CSS you&rsquo;d like to be used directly, bypassing the limits of these menus.</p>
<p>You may also alter the font size used on the Edit tab through use of the commands available to you under the View menu.</p>
<h2 id="view-your-notes-as-a-list">View Your Notes as a List</h2>
<p>The first half of the Notenik display shows all the Notes in your current Collection as a simple list, initially sorted by Title.
You can navigate through this list using some of the buttons on the Toolbar:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Home button takes you to the first Note.</li>
<li>&lsquo;&lt;&rsquo; Takes you to the prior note.</li>
<li>&lsquo;&gt;&rsquo; Takes you to the next note.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the same navigational commands are available under the Note menu, with handy keyboard shortcuts noted on the right. There you will also find a command to scroll the list so as to bring the currently selected Note into view at the top of the displayed Notes.</p>
<h2 id="sync-your-notes">Sync Your Notes</h2>
<p>Since a Collection of Notes lives on your local storage as a folder full of text files, it can be easily synced to the cloud and/or to other devices via a service such as <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> or <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/icloud-drive/">iCloud</a>. Simply store your Collection somewhere in your Dropbox folder, or in your iCloud Drive folder.</p>
<h2 id="format-the-body-of-a-note-using-markdown">Format the Body of a Note using Markdown</h2>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is a simple syntax for formatting plain text files so that they can be easily read and written by humans, but also can easily be converted into HTML for use on the Web. If you&rsquo;d like, you can use the Markdown syntax for formatting the body of each note. But it&rsquo;s not required.</p>
<p>When you view a Note on the Display tab, you will see the Body Field Value converted to HTML using a Markdown parser. If you haven&rsquo;t used any special Markdown formatting, then the text will simply appear as you entered it.</p>
<p>Notenik uses the <a href="https://github.com/iwasrobbed/Down">Down</a> parser to convert from Markdown to HTML.</p>
<h2 id="add-other-fields-to-your-notes">Add Other Fields to Your Notes</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said that, at their most basic, each Note consists of a Title Field and a Body Field. But each Note can actually contain any number of fields.</p>
<p>Each Field in a Note consists of the Field&rsquo;s Label, followed by a colon and one or more spaces, followed by the Field&rsquo;s Value.</p>
<p>In other words, something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Title: This is a Sample Note
</code></pre>
<p>Field Labels must follow a few rules. A Field Label must always start at the beginning of a line. A Field Label may not consist of more than 48 characters, and may not contain a comma (&lsquo;,&rsquo;).</p>
<p>The Field Value may be specified on the same line, and/or on one or more following lines.</p>
<p>The Body Field, if present, will always be the last Field in a Note, since all following text will be assumed to be part of the Body (even if it contains strings of text that might otherwise appear to be additional Field Labels).</p>
<p>Each Field Label may be considered to have a <em>proper form</em> (including capitalization, spaces and punctuation), and a <em>common form</em> (the proper form without capitalization, whitespace or punctuation). The common form is considered to be the key identifier for the Field, so that any variations of the Label that include the same letters and digits in the same sequence will be considered equivalent.</p>
<p>The Notenik approach to identifying fields within a Note is very similar to the <a href="http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/metadata.html">Multimarkdown metadata syntax</a>, and also similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a>.</p>
<h2 id="organize-your-notes-with-tags">Organize Your Notes with Tags</h2>
<p>The Tags Field offers another way to organize the Notes within a Collection.
Tags may be used to group related notes into categories. One or more tags may be associated with each note, and each tag may contain one or more sub-tags. A period or a slash may be used to separate one level of a tag from the next level, with the period being preferred. A comma or a semi-colon may be used to separate one tag from another, with the comma being preferred.</p>
<p>Click on the Tags tab to see your Notes organized by tags, instead of appearing in a straight List. If a Note has multiple Tags assigned, then it will appear multiple times on the Tags tab, once for each Tag. By adding multiple levels to your Tags, you can effectively organize your Notes into an outline.</p>
<h2 id="add-a-link-field-to-make-a-bookmark">Add a Link Field to Make a Bookmark</h2>
<p>A Link Field within Notenik is intended to hold a URL: a hyperlink to a location on the Web (or to a local file, if you&rsquo;d prefer to use it that way).
You can easily Launch a link from within Notenik by clicking on the Launch Link button in the Toolbar.</p>
<p>Adding a Link to a Note doesn&rsquo;t necessarily reduce the Note to a simple Bookmark, but this is certainly one way to use a Collection of Notes.</p>
<p>Note that if you use a Link to point to a local folder containing another Notenik Collection, then Launching that Link will result in opening the linked Collection within Notenik.</p>
<p>You may use the Set Local Link command under the Note menu to choose a file or folder to be linked; the resulting &lsquo;file:///&rsquo; style of URL will then replace any value previously stored in the Link field for the current Note.</p>
<h2 id="override-default-fields-with-a-template-file">Override Default Fields with a Template file</h2>
<p>By default, Notenik shows only four Fields for a Note: Title, Link, Tags and Body. However, this default may be altered by placing a file named &lsquo;template.txt&rsquo; or &lsquo;template.md&rsquo; within a Collection&rsquo;s folder. Such a file should be in the normal Notenik format, although the Field Labels specified need not have any accompanying values. When such a template file is found, the field names found in this file will be used as the fields to be displayed and maintained for that Collection, overriding the default four.
You may use the Preferences command under the Collection menu to modify the template for the current Collection. Just put a check mark next to whichever fields you&rsquo;d like to use for that particular Collection. Then click on the OK button to save your template with the indicated fields.</p>
<p>You can also use any text editor to modify the sample template file to reflect the fields you desire for that Collection.</p>
<p>When creating a new Collection, you will be presented with the Collection Preferences window automatically, to give you a chance to customize the fields to be used for that new Collection.</p>
<p>The file extension used for the template file will be used as the file extension for Notes subsequently created within the Collection.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-file-template">A Note File Template</h2>
<p>Following is a sample Note file, showing all of the Fields that Notenik treats as special in some way. Feel free to copy and paste to create a template file, as described in the previous section.</p>
<pre><code>Title:  The unique title for this note

Author: The author of the Note

Date:   2016-12-13

Status: 0 - Suggested

Type:   The type of note

Seq:    Rev Letter or Version Number

Tags:   One or more tags, separated by commas

Link:   http://notenik.com

Rating: 5

Index:  Index Term 1;

Code: 

A block of programming code

Teaser:

A brief sample of the note

Body:

The substance of the note
</code></pre>
<h2 id="sequence-your-notes">Sequence Your Notes</h2>
<p>Add a Seq Field to a Collection (using a template file) in order to specify a sequence number, revision letter, version number or priority to be associated with each Note.
A Seq field may contain letters, digits and one or more periods (aka decimal points) or hyphens or a dollar sign (&lsquo;$&rsquo;).</p>
<p>You may wish to assign a unique Seq value to each Note in a Collection, but Notenik does not require this (in other words, it does allow duplicate Seq values to be assigned to different Notes).</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see your Notes listed in sequence by their assigned number, you can use the Sort Menu to change the sequence of the displayed list from Title to Seq + Title.</p>
<p>If you want to insert a new note with a Seq Value already assigned to another Note, then first select the other Note, then use the Increment command under the Note menu to increment the Seq field of the existing note, as well as following notes that might otherwise cause duplicate Seq values.</p>
<p>To add a new Note with the next available Seq value, first select the last note in the list (the one with the highest seq field) and then add a New Note in the normal manner.</p>
<h2 id="track-the-status-of-your-notes">Track the Status of Your Notes</h2>
<p>Add an optional Status Field to your Collection, indicating each Note&rsquo;s degree of completion, and you have a basic To Do List.</p>
<p>Status values are usually selected from the following standard list. Note that each status may be represented by a single digit and/or an associated label. The digits serve to place the values into an approximate life cycle sequence.</p>
<ul>
<li>0 - Suggested</li>
<li>1 - Proposed</li>
<li>2 - Approved</li>
<li>3 - Planned</li>
<li>4 - Active</li>
<li>5 - Held</li>
<li>6 - Completed</li>
<li>7 - Pending Recurs</li>
<li>8 - Canceled</li>
<li>9 - Closed</li>
</ul>
<p>The labels may be modified by placing a series of integer + label pairs in the Value area of the relevant template file, with separating punctuation. Such a template line might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Status: 1 - Idea; 4 - In Work; 9 - Published;
</code></pre>
<p>Look under the File menu for an option to Purge Notes that have been Canceled or Completed. You&rsquo;ll be given the option of discarding the purged Notes, or of copying them to another location.</p>
<h2 id="date-your-notes">Date Your Notes</h2>
<p>Add a Date field to a Collection in order to track the date each note was officially published, or a due date for each note. A date may be expressed in any of a number of common formats. It may also be a partial date, such as a year, or a year and a month. It may or may not contain a specific time of day.</p>
<p>Note that the Date field has several helpful editing tools. You can enter a free-form date yourself, or you can use a Calendar widget to pick dates from a Calendar. You can use the Today button to set the date to Today&rsquo;s date, and you can use the Recurs button to apply the Recurs rule, if one has been supplied.</p>
<h2 id="specify-date-recurs-rules">Specify Date Recurs Rules</h2>
<p>Add a Recurs field to a Collection to cause a Date for a Note to recur on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Specify a recurs rule using normal English, such as &ldquo;Every 3 months,&rdquo; &ldquo;Every Tuesday&rdquo; or &ldquo;Every Year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Use the Recurs button on the Date editing row to apply the rule to the current Date associated with the selected Note.</p>
<h2 id="track-your-tasks">Track Your Tasks</h2>
<p>Add a Status field, a Seq field, a Date field and a Recurs field to a Collection, and you have all the elements of a personal task management system.</p>
<p>A Collection such as this can use the Date field to track due dates, and/or the Seq field to track priorities. If desired, use the Tags field to group tasks by context and/or by project.</p>
<p>If you use the Close Note option under the Note menu, then you can cause the Due Date to recur (if a Recurs field is available), or the Status field to show the task as Completed, if it is not eligible to recur.</p>
<p>The Sort menu contains two options specific to task tracking. The first option sorts all the Notes in a list by Date and then Seq, while the second option sorts all tasks by Seq and then Date. In both cases, completed tasks sort to the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget the Purge Option under the File menu, which will allow you to purge Cancelled and Completed Notes from a Collection.</p>
<h2 id="add-code-snippets-to-your-notes">Add Code Snippets to Your Notes</h2>
<p>Add a Code field to a Collection in order to store a code snippet as part of each Note in that Collection.
The code block you enter in a Code field will be formatted on the Display tab enclosed in pre and code tags, so that line breaks will be honored, and the code will be displayed using a monospaced font.</p>
<h2 id="search-for-one-or-more-notes-containing-specified-text">Search for One or More Notes Containing Specified Text</h2>
<p>The Search field on the Toolbar allows you to search for the entered text, and display the first Note containing this text in any field being searched. After finding the first occurrence, you may use the Find Again command under the Note menu to search for the next Note containing the specified text.
The Search function will search each Note&rsquo;s Title, Link, Tags and Body fields for matching text. Case (upper- or lower-) will be ignored for the purposes of the Search.</p>
<h2 id="use-other-special-fields">Use Other Special Fields</h2>
<p>You can use whatever Field Labels you want within a Collection, but there are a few other Field Labels that have some special Notenik logic associated with them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Author &ndash; The author(s) of the Note.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rating &ndash; Your rating of the note, on a scale of one to five.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type &ndash; The type of note. Any values may be used to distinguish between different types of notes within a collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaser &ndash; An excerpt from the note used as a teaser in a list of notes. The teaser may be formatted using Markdown.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="run-reports">Run Reports</h2>
<p>Notenik provides a function for merging data from Notes into a template file in order to create one or more output text files.</p>
<p>The text files created may be of any type, but certainly one of the most useful formats is html, allowing users to generate one or more Web pages from their notes.</p>
<p>See the <a href="merge-template.html">Merge Template File Spec</a> for complete information on the expected format of a Merge Template file.</p>
<p>Template files should be placed in a folder named &lsquo;reports&rsquo; within the Collection folder where the reports are to be used. Each template file should include the word &lsquo;template&rsquo; somewhere within its file name.</p>
<p>Once a template file is created, suitably named and placed, it will become available as a report that can be selected from a drop-down (identified with a gear icon) on the Collection&rsquo;s toolbar.</p>
<p>Selecting a report will then cause the Collection&rsquo;s notes to be merged into the corresponding template file, creating whatever ouput is identified in the template file.</p>
<h2 id="import-and-export-your-notes">Import and Export Your Notes</h2>
<p>You can import and export a Collection in a variety of formats, using commands found under the File menu.
Following are the supported formats.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Import/Export in Notenik Format</p>
<p>You can import and export your Notes in the current collection from/to a folder in the same Notenik format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Import/Export in Tab-Delimited Format</p>
<p>Each Note will be represented as one row/line, and each field will be represented in a separate column. Tabs are used to separate columns. This format is suitable for import into MS Excel, for example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Import/Export in CSV Format</p>
<p>Each Note will be represented as one row/line, and each field will be represented in a separate column. Commas are used to separate columns. This format is suitable for import into MS Excel, for example.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="favorites-to-html">Favorites to HTML</h2>
<p>If you have a Collection of Notes representing Web Bookmarks, then you may wish to use the &lsquo;Favorites&rsquo; tag to identify the bookmarks you reference most often. You may then use a sub-tag within the &lsquo;Favorites&rsquo; tag to organize your favorite bookmarks into categories. Once you&rsquo;ve identified your Favorites, then you may use the Favorites to HTML command under the File menu to create a Web page containing all your favorite bookmarks, organized under headings representing the categories you have chosen. Notenik will display your favorites in four columns, with a maximum of 32 lines per column. Assuming a reasonable number of favorite bookmarks, these will typically display all of your favorites within a single Web page on your Mac. You may then wish to identify the resuling page as the homepage within all of your Web browsers (Safari, Chrome, etc.).</p>
<h2 id="keeping-track-of-your-collections">Keeping Track of Your Collections</h2>
<p>If you keep all your Notes in a single Collection, then you will never need to worry about which notes are where.
If you have multiple Collections of Notes, though, then you will probably want some way of keeping track of them.</p>
<p>Notenik automatically keeps track of Collections you have recently opened, and you can always see this list, and select a Collection to open, by using the Open Recent command under the File menu.</p>
<p>Note that this list is presented with the most recently opened Collections at the top, and then proceeding downwards to those accessed less recently.</p>
<p>Another option is to use the Open Parent Realm command under the File menu. You will then be asked to choose a folder. Once you&rsquo;ve made that choice, Notenik will scan all likely folders within the parent folder, looking for Notenik Collections. You will then be presented with a window showing a virtual &lsquo;Collection of Collections&rsquo;. Clicking the Launch Link Toolbar button for one of these Collections will then cause Notenik to open that Collection in another new window.</p>
<h2 id="view-the-log">View the Log</h2>
<p>Under the Window Menu, you&rsquo;ll find an entry for the Log window.
You can usually ignore the Log, but if Notenik is not behaving as you think it should, a look at the Log window can sometimes help determine what is going on.</p>

<h2 id="files-and-folders">Files and Folders</h2>
<p>Each Collection is stored within its own folder. You may store each Collection wherever you like. You may wish to store one or more of your Collections in a special folder used by a syncing service such as iCloud or Dropbox, in which case your Collection will be synced just like any other files and folders managed by that service.
Within each Collection folder you will find one file for each Note in the Collection, with the file name based closely on the Note&rsquo;s title.</p>
<p>In addition to the Note files, the following special files and folders may be found within a Collection folder.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each Collection folder will contain a special file named &lsquo;- INFO.nnk&rsquo;. This is a plain text file, in Notenik format, containing some handy metadata about the Collection, such as the last sort sequence set for it. If you sync a Collection to other devices using a service such as iCloud or Dropbox, then this metadata will be synced as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each Collection folder will also contain a special file named &lsquo;- README.txt&rsquo;. This file simply identifies the folder as a Notenik Collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each Collection folder will normally also contain a &lsquo;template.txt&rsquo; or &lsquo;template.md&rsquo; file identifying the fields used within the Collection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
