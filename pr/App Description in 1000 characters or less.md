Markdown formatting may be used in the body field, In addition to a title and a body, each Note may have multiple other fields associated with it. Notenik includes a templating system and a scripting system. Used together, these features allow Notenik to generate HTML from collections of notes, and the author has used these features to publish several of his own websites. Note collections may be stored and synced via iCloud drive. Although Notenik is only available on the Mac, notes may be viewed and edited using any text editor.
