<h2>Common Fields</h2>

<p>The following field labels are predefined within Notenik, and have special meanings, as indicated below.</p>
<h3>Author</h3>
<p>Identifies the author(s) of the Note.</p>
<h3>Body</h3>
<p>The Body consists of the text of the Note, containing as many words as you like, over multiple lines. The Body field can be formatted using <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>The Code Field is intended to contain a code snippet associated with the Note, using a relevant coding language (HTML, Java, etc.).</p>
<p>A Code Field would typically consist of multiple lines, and would be displayed in a monospaced font, and without any interpretation or execution of the code found within.</p>
<h3>Date</h3>
<p>The Date Field may be used to track a date of some significance. Depending on the nature of the Collection, the Date Field might be used to track a due date, or a date published.</p>
<p>A Date Field is assumed to contain a complete or partial date, represented as a string. If a partial date is desired, then Year, or Year and Month, may be specified without a Day of Month. A Date Field may or may not contain a specific time of day.</p>
<h3>Index</h3>
<p>An Index Field can contain one or more terms under which this Note should appear in an index of the Collection. Multiple terms can be entered by using a semi-colon (‘;’) to end each term entry. A URL to be associated with the term can be placed in parentheses following the term. If the term should reference a specific anchor within the Note, then the anchor can be specified by preceding it with the usual pound sign (‘#’).</p>
<h3>Link</h3>
<p>A Link field contains a URL/hyperlink to a related resource. This may be a link to a resource on the Web, or to a local file, or to another Collection.</p>
<h3>Rating</h3>
<p>A rating of the note, on a scale of one to five.</p>
<h3>Recurs</h3>
<p>A Recurs Field may be used to specify a recurrence rule for the Date Field. The Recurs Value may be specified using normal English, such as “Every 3 months, “Every Tuesday” or “Every Year”.</p>
<h3>Seq</h3>
<p>A Seq field may be used to specify a sequence number, revision letter, or version number.</p>
<p>A Seq field may contain letters, digits and one or more periods (aka decimal points) or hyphens or a dollar sign (’$’).</p>
<p>A Seq value may be consistently and systematically incremented, and may be compared to another Seq value for equality or for sequencing.</p>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>A Status Field identifies a degree of readiness/completion for a Note.</p>
<p>Status values are usually selected from a standard list. Note that each status may be represented by a single digit and/or an associated label. The digits serve to place the values into an approximate life cycle sequence. See the <a href="status.html">next page</a> for the standard values.</p>
<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>A tag represents a particular topic or category. One or more tags may be assigned to each Note, and each tag may have sub-tags. Each tag may consist of multiple levels, with the first level being the primary tag and subsequent levels being sub-categories. All of the tags and sub-tags for a Note are defined within a single Tags Field.</p>
<p>A period or a slash may be used to separate one level of a tag from the next level, with the period being preferred. A comma or a semi-colon may be used to separate one tag from another, with the comma being preferred.</p>
<h3>Teaser</h3>
<p>An excerpt or summary of the Note that is meant to help readers decide whether they wish to read the full Body. The Teaser Field would typically consist of multiple lines.</p>
<h3>Title</h3>
<p>A simple string, typically confined to a single line, containing a few words describing the subject of the Note.</p>
<h3>Type</h3>
<p>A simple string indicating the type of note. Any values may be used to distinguish between different types of notes within a collection.</p>
