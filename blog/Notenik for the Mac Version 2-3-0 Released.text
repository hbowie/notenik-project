Title:  Notenik for the Mac Version 2.3.0 Released

Seq:    6

Status: 9 - Published

Date:   10 Dec 2019

Teaser: 

Fixed treatment of the Teaser field, to treat it as a long text field; increased tolerance for Notes with alternative formatting; added Ink as an alternate for parsing of Markdown; added an optional Timestamp field, as a first step to enabling use of Notenik to create a Zettelkasten. 


Body: 

A few more fixes and improvementsâ€¦

* Modified treatment of the Teaser field to treat it as a long text field. 

* Added an optional Timestamp field which will create a series of digits representing the year, month, day, hour, minute and second on which the Note was created. This can be used as a fixed ID for each note, in line with the concept of a *Zettelkasten*.

* Increased the tolerance for parsing Notes that use a Markdown level 1 header to identify the Note's title.

* Added a second Markdown parser, Ink, which can be used as an alternative to Down.
