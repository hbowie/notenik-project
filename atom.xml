	  	<p>Yes, that&apos;s right &#8211; <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984?mt=12">Notenik version 5.0.0 has just been released</a>, in all likelihood closing the books on 2020. So this feels like a good time to take a breather and look back on the path we&apos;ve traveled, along with new routes yet to explore. </p>
<p>I started work on the current version of Notenik &#8211; written in Swift, specifically for macOS &#8211; in January of 2019. </p>
<p>Version 1.0.0 was released in the Mac App Store in June of that same year. </p>
<p>After the initial release, I fell into a routine of advancing the version number by 0.1.0 with each update (except for a handful of emergency fixes that exercised that third digit). </p>
<p>So that means 40 significant releases in the last year and a half, for an average of one new release every two weeks or so &#8211; which feels like a pretty good clip! </p>
<p>That first version started out with the ability to manage one or more collections of notes &#8211; with each note containing one or more fields &#8211; and to present lists of notes as well as an outline view organized by tags. </p>
<p>In addition to a continual stream of minor refinements, the following significant capabilities have been added along the way: </p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining a collection of web bookmarks, with the ability to generate a Favorites page in HTML; </li>
<li>Adding file attachments to notes; </li>
<li>Merging note information into templates to generate HTML pages, and scripting to sort and filter notes, and pump them through a series of templates. </li>
<li>Various refinements for handling custom field types, such as Date, Recurs and Seq. </li>
<li>Adjustments to handle folders full of text files not originally created by, nor intended for use with, Notenik; </li>
<li>Creation of a custom Markdown parser for use by Notenik; </li>
<li>Support for wiki-style links between Notes; </li>
<li>Support for bookmarks, citations, and tables of contents &#8211; all extensions to the original Markdown syntax. </li>
</ul>
<p>I&apos;ve had email correspondence with a number of Notenik users, all making enlightening suggestions about how the app could be improved or expanded in a variety of ways, and I&apos;ve been able to implement <a href="https://notenik.net/issues.html">about 80% of these ideas</a>, usually within a week or two. </p>
<p>Notenik&apos;s rating in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984?mt=12">App Store</a> now stands at 4.9 (out of 5), based on submissions from 17 users. Five users have submitted reviews, all of them with positive comments. </p>
<p>All of this has been a labor of love &#8211; I charge nothing for Notenik, the code is all <a href="https://github.com/hbowie/notenik-swift">open-source</a>, and I collect no data from users. But during the last couple of years, and 2020 in particular, I&apos;ve been grateful for a retirement project that allows me to turn away from the television, the news feed, the social media chatter, and the email, and permits me to focus on building something tangible that I and others can use. It&apos;s a great joy. </p>
<p>So what&apos;s in the queue for 2021? </p>
<p>It would be great to get some broader exposure for Notenik. In particular, some sort of published third-party review of the app would be really helpful in getting the word out to potential users. </p>
<p>And then there&apos;s more code to write. At some point I&apos;d like to get an iOS version of Notenik out there. And a version that runs on a Web server would also be intriguing. But then, just when I think I&apos;m done for a while, there&apos;s yet another feature to add to the existing macOS app. </p>
<p>There&apos;s more fun to be had, for sure. <a href="https://notenik.net/rss.xml">Stay tuned</a>, and climb on board to be part of the journey! </p>

	  	<p>My current recommendations for those just starting to use Notenik to generate a website. </p>

	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
	  	<![CDATA[
	  	<p>One of the many things that <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984?mt=12">Notenik</a> can be used for is website generation. </p>
<p>I&apos;ve set this up in many different ways over the years, for a number of different sites that I have authored. </p>
<p>If you&apos;d like to know more about the evolution of my thinking in this regard, you might want to take a look at this <a href="evolving-use-of-notenik-for-web-generation.html">previous post</a>. </p>
<p>But if you&apos;d just like to cut to the chase, and learn what I would consider current best practices, then this post is for you. (In any case, though, come back here if you decide to take a detour to read the history lesson.) </p>
<h2 id="folder-structure">Folder Structure</h2>
<p>Let me start by explaining the recommended folder structure. </p>
<p>The top level folder should be given whatever name is meaningful to you. This entire folder can then be put under version control using <a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a>, and uploaded to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, or any other online repository you happen to be using. The entire contents of this folder can then be uploaded to your web server, or web hosting service, using your preferred FTP software. (I use <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/mac">Tower</a> and <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> for these chores, respectively.) </p>
<p>This top level folder will eventually hold all of your html files, which will have been generated using Notenik. It will initially be empty, except for&hellip; </p>
<p>A subfolder named <strong>notes</strong> will then contain all of your actual Notes that are normally maintained by Notenik. Each note is stored in a plain text file, and contains a page of content, along with suitable metadata about that content. </p>
<p>A subfolder named <strong>files</strong> may exist within the <code>notes</code> folder. This folder would contain any note attachments, potentially including image files (jpeg or png files, for example). </p>
<p>A subfolder named <strong>mirror</strong> should be nested within the <code>notes</code> folder. This folder would then contain whatever files are used to <em>mirror</em> the content from the Notenik format to the final html format found in the top folder. </p>
<p>The following subfolders would then be placed within the <code>mirror</code> folder. </p>
<p>The <strong>css</strong> folder would be used to store any cascading stylesheet files. </p>
<p>An <strong>includes</strong> folder can be used for any chunks of html to be included from one or more template files. </p>
<p>A <strong>scripts</strong> folder can be used for any Notenik scripting files to be run. </p>
<p>A <strong>templates</strong> folder would be used for the various templates that would be used to convert your notes to html. </p>
<p>And that&apos;s it for the standard folder structure. Other subfolders may of course be added as needed, depending on the nature of your site. </p>
<h2 id="notenik-features">Notenik Features</h2>
<p>Notenik has a number of features that have been provided to facilitate website generation using the folder structure described above. </p>
<p>If you&apos;re starting from scratch, then you can use the <strong>New Web Collection</strong> command beneath the <code>Files</code> menu to create a new set of folders organized in this way. </p>
<p>If you have an existing Collection, then you can use the <strong>Stash Notes in Subfolder</strong> command beneath the <code>Transform</code> menu to reorganize your existing Collection, moving your existing Notes and subfolders into a new subfolder named <code>notes</code>. </p>
<p>In either case, when you go to open the Web Collection at a later date, simply use the normal <strong>Open</strong> command beneath the <code>File</code> menu, being sure to select the top-level folder &#8211; the one above the <code>notes</code> subfolder. In this way, Notenik will have the permissions it needs to write web pages into that top-level folder. </p>
<p>If you used the first command discussed above, to start from scratch, then your Collection will already contain a sample <code>mirror</code> folder. Otherwise, use the <strong>Generate Sample Mirror Folder</strong> command beneath the <code>Transform</code> menu to create some sample files and folders for mirroring. Feel free to modify these to suit your needs. </p>
<p>However you create it, if your Notenik collection has a subfolder named <code>mirror</code>, which in turn contains another folder named <code>templates</code>, which in turn contains a file whose name is something like <strong>note_mirror.html</strong> (containing both the word <code>note</code> and the word <code>mirror</code>), then that template file will be run every time you update one of your notes. And if that template file is set up to write to a location three levels above its location, then you will end up having a webpage created for each Note in your collection, and each webpage will be kept up-to-date as you make changes to your Collection. </p>
<p>If your <code>templates</code> folder also contains a file whose name is something like <strong>index_mirror.html</strong>, then that file will be run whenever you request indexing from a command beneath the <code>Transform</code> menu. Alternatively, if you select that option as part of the Collection Preferences, the index will be regenerated every time any page in the collection is updated. </p>
<p>And if you&apos;d like to visit the generated <strong>index.html</strong> page in your Web browser, then you can select <strong>Browse Web Index</strong> beneath the <code>Transform</code> menu. </p>

	  	<p>Some history about how my latest thinking has evolved. </p>

	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
	  	<![CDATA[
	  	<p>I&apos;ve been using <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984?mt=12">Notenik written in Swift for the Mac</a>, or one of its predecessors (Notenik written in Java, or PSTextMerge before that, or TDF Czar before that) to generate my websites (starting with <a href="https://www.reasontorock.com">ReasonToRock.com</a>) for almost 20 years. </p>
<p>For almost all of that time, I&apos;ve used a homegrown <a href="https://notenik.net/script-spec.html">scripting language</a>, and a homegrown <a href="https://notenik.net/template-spec.html">templating language</a>, to generate those sites from some sort of separate data source: tab-delimited files, to start with. </p>
<p>Over this time, my thoughts about the data source and its relationship to the final website, as well as the script and template files used to convert one to the other, have evolved gradually, coming to some sort of conclusion, I think, with the <a href="https://notenik.net/swift.html#version-history">4.9.0 release of Notenik</a>. </p>
<p>Let me briefly note the steps in this evolution, before explaining my latest thoughts. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I originally used <a href="https://textile-lang.com">Textile</a> formatting for my content, but switched to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> after Reason to Rock. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I moved my primary data source(s) from some sort of tab-delimited file to a collection of text files in the <a href="https://notenik.net/blog/the-thinking-behind-the-notenik-file-format.html">Notenik format</a>. Each Note, then, contains a piece of content, as well as metadata about that content. And both can be edited using Notenik, or any text editor available for macOS. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I originally placed my content and my metadata and my scripts and templates in various folders that were separate from the resulting website, or perhaps sat alongside the resulting site. I eventually realized a couple of problems with this arrangement: a) the whole kit and caboodle was not as portable as it might have been, since the source files were not stored together with the generated html files; and b) with recent changes in macOS security, Notenik would end up reading data from one folder that it had been granted access to, but then trying to write to a different folder, to which it did not have access. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of my html generation was originally triggered manually, when I explicitly told Notenik to run a script that I had recorded/written. I eventually realized, though, that it might be better to update the corresponding html page of content whenever the original Notenik page was updated. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I briefly flirted with the idea of having Notenik mirror each Note to a corresponding html page that would sit in the same folder. After seeing the results, though, I realized that this was a bit messy. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And so, with the 4.9.0 release of Notenik I&apos;ve added some new features that seem to resolve the latest set of issues. </p>
<p>However, nothing that worked before has been broken or disabled. In fact, my various websites still use all of the things listed above that I have decided to move away from, and Notenik still works to regenerate all of those sites whenever I have the need to do so. </p>
<p>For anyone coming to Notenik for the first time, though, I&apos;d like to explain what I would consider current best practices for using Notenik to generate web pages and sites. </p>
<p>And that is the topic for the <a href="current-best-practices-for-notenik-web-generation.html">next post</a>. </p>

	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
	  	<![CDATA[
	  	<p>Well, we&apos;ve had a bunch of updates to Notenik since my last blog post, so let me try to hit the high points here. Some of these were attempts to scratch itches that I was feeling, while others were implemented in response to requests/suggestions from other users. In addition to the list below, there were several minor tweaks to improve the user experience. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notenik now has its own iCloud container, which means that Collections stored at this location can be more easily accessed, either through an Open from iCloud option beneath the File menu, or from the new Navigation Board. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Navigation board can be opened from a new option beneath the File menu. It will also appear when you close the last open Collection without quitting. This window allows easy opening of recently opened Collections, as well as Collections stored in Notenik&apos;s iCloud container. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added some drag and drop support. Users can now drag a bookmark from the URL field at the top of a browser window and drop it anywhere on the list view of a Collection to add the bookmark as a new Note. You can also drag a Note from one Collection to another. Contacts and Emails can also be imported in very basic ways. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duplicates are now treated differently &#8211; Notenik will simply append a sequence number and allow the duplicate title to be added to the Collection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double-clicking a Note from the List tab will now attempt to launch whatever Link the Note may have. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new command beneath the Note menu will discard any edits currently in work. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another new command beneath the Note menu will increment the major portion of a two-part Seq field instead of the minor portion. As an example, incrementing &apos;1.00&apos; would result in a new value of &apos;2.00&apos;, instead of &apos;1.01&apos;. Any subsequent values that would result in duplicates will also be incremented. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a couple of Collection preferences that allow the Display of a Note to be altered slightly. One option will do away with an explicit Body field label in the Note display; the other option will display a Note&apos;s title as a level 1 heading. Both options may be valuable for Collections of Notes that are primarily intended to be viewed as documents. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal wiki-style links between Notes have been enhanced so that timestamps will be used to prevent links from breaking if link targets are renamed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notenik&apos;s own Markdown parser has been refined. Several bugs have been fixed. An option to automatically generate a Table of Contents has been added, along with support for Multimarkdown-style footnotes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new Counts window is available, which will show character, line and word counts for the currently selected Note. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new Sort option is available, to sort by Tags. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added new keyboard shortcuts for status updates. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users can now specify a &apos;pick-from&apos; field type in a template file, and specify the allowable values. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users can also specify a Boolean format for a custom field, with the field being represented by a checkbox on the Edit tab. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added new Note sharing options for formatting a Note as a Quotation, in either Markdown or HTML. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added an import option for XML that will allow users of iWisdom to import their collections of quotations into Notenik (since iWisdom is no longer supported). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For those interested in the code, the monolithic Notenik project was refactored to break out several reusable packages: NotenikUtils, for the most general-purpose utilities; NotenikMkdown, for the internal Markdown parser; NotenikTextile, for the beginnings of a rudimentary Textile parser; and NotenikLib, for Notenik code that might be reused on platforms other than the Mac. </p>
</li>
</ul>

	  	<p>A summary of notable changes to the Mac App since December, 2019. </p>

	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
	  	<![CDATA[
	  	<p>There have been a few version releases since I last wrote about recent changes in the <a href="https://notenik.net/blog.html">blog</a> back in December, so let me hit on some of the more significant recent developments. </p>
<ul>
<li>The most recent release, 3.2.0, added a new internal Markdown parser as a third alternative, in addition to <a href="https://github.com/iwasrobbed/Down">Down</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Ink">Ink</a>. It&apos;s probably not quite perfect, but I tried to stick as close as possible to John Gruber&apos;s documentation of the functionality intended for both <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/">SmartyPants</a>, and it seems to be working pretty well for me. The main improvement here is better handling of wiki-style inter-note links. These are now only available when using the internal parser, but no longer require you to specifically request this feature: it&apos;s just built in to the new parser. See the Application Preferences to select the new parser. </li>
<li>Added the ability to mirror a Collection of Notes to an alternate format &#8211; most usefully, HTML. This new ability makes it super easy to generate a simple website that anyone can access with a Web browser. Once you set this up, the HTML mirror copies are automatically kept up-to-date for you in the background, as you go about working on the text files within Notenik. See the new Transform menu for commands to help you set this up. </li>
<li>The Edit view is now scrollable, in case the number of fields in a Collection is too large to fit in the available space for the window. </li>
<li>The Collection Preferences window was redesigned to make it more usable. </li>
<li>Notenik is now available in the App Store for users still on High Sierra. </li>
<li>Made a few usability improvements, including the addition of the day of week name next to the date on a Note&apos;s display view, and the addition of the letter &apos;T&apos; in the leftmost column in the List view to indicate Notes with dates of today. </li>
<li>A number of bugs have been fixed. </li>
<li>Restructured the User Guide to make it easer to use. </li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, see the Notenik <a href="https://notenik.net/swift.html#version-history">Version History</a> and the relevant sections of the <a href="https://notenik.net/swift.html">User Guide</a> for further details.  And drop me a line at &lt;support@notenik.net&gt; if any problems or questions. </p>

	  <title>Using Notenik with Existing Text Files</title>

	  	<p>Since Notenik is rather late to the game of managing text files, and since those already using similar sorts of files are probably among those interested in my app, I wanted to talk a bit about how the latest version of Notenik can be used with existing folders full of text files. </p>

	  </summary>
	  <content type="html">
	  	<![CDATA[
	  	<p>As I&apos;ve noted in another recent blog post, <a href="https://notenik.net/blog/the-thinking-behind-the-notenik-file-format.html">Notenik uses its own unique file format</a>. However, since Notenik is rather late to the game of managing text files, and since those already using similar sorts of files are probably among those interested in my app, I wanted to talk a bit about how the latest version of Notenik can be used with existing folders full of text files. The information provided below includes a number of updates made starting with version 2.6.0 and continuing through 2.9.0. </p>
<p>First, philosophically, Notenik tries to follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Postel&apos;s Law</a>: </p>
<p>&gt; Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not possible for Notenik to be endlessly liberal in this regard, and there are certainly loosely formatted text files that may not be interpreted by Notenik according to the author&apos;s wishes. </p>
<h3 id="rules-for-reading">Rules for Reading</h3>
<p>With that being said, here are some rules that Notenik will try to apply to interpret existing text files in the best possible manner. (Many or even most of these rules involve recognition of the start of the note&apos;s body, even though the note lacks the explicit &apos;Body:&apos; field label found in the standard Notenik format.) </p>
<ol>
<li>Notenik will respect a template file that it finds, but it does not insist on the presence of a template file. </li>
<li>Notenik will place a file named &apos;- INFO.nnk&apos; in any folder that it opens successfully. Notenik uses this file to track some basic info about the Collection. Notenik also uses the presence of this file to indicate that the folder contains a Notenik Collection. </li>
<li>Notenik will generally respect whatever metadata tags are found at the top of the file, unless you have specified otherwise. In this respect, Notenik generally follows the same conventions as the <a href="https://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/metadata.html">MultiMarkdown Metadata</a> specification. </li>
<li>In accordance with this same spec, Notenik will respect a line of three dashes before and after the metadata, to indicate the start and end of the metadata block. The line after the metadata can also be one of four periods. </li>
<li>Notenik normally expects to see blank lines between metadata fields, for improved readability. However, if the first line contains a Title field, and is immediately followed by another metadata field, without an intervening blank line, then Notenik will assume that the first blank line encountered should end the metadata block and start the body of the note. </li>
<li>If a file does not begin with any metadata, but starts with a normal <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#header">Markdown level 1 heading</a>, then Notenik will use the contents of that heading as the title of the note. </li>
<li>If a file does not start with either metadata or a Markdown level 1 heading, then Notenik will use the file name (dropping the file extension) as the title of the note, and use the entire contents of the file as the body. </li>
<li>If a file does not start with metadata, but does start with a Markdown level 1 heading, then the second line of the file may use a &apos;#&apos;, immediately followed by text (without any intervening spaces) to indicate that the text should be treated as tags for the note. I&apos;m not quite sure where this convention originated, or how many people use it, but there it is. </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="rules-for-updating">Rules for Updating</h3>
<p>When a note is updated, Notenik will generally try to respect each file&apos;s existing format, rather than rewriting the note using Notenik&apos;s format. </p>
<h3 id="rules-for-new-notes">Rules for New Notes</h3>
<p>New notes will be written out using Notenik&apos;s file format. </p>
<h3 id="converting-an-entire-collection">Converting an Entire Collection</h3>
<p>If you wish to convert an existing collection of files so that they all are consistently formatted using the standard Notenik format, then the best way to do this is to open your existing folder, review it to make sure that all or most of the data is being interpreted favorably, and then use the Export command beneath the File menu to export the collection into the Notenik format. This will create a new folder containing all of your notes, formatted in the Notenik format. </p>
<h3 id="backing-up">Backing Up</h3>
<p>Notenik is open-source software released under the terms of the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>. I mention this only to emphasize the point that, although I&apos;ve done everything I can think of to enable Notenik to be used with existing folders full of text files, the software is provided &quot;As Is&quot;, without warranty of any kind. If you have problems, I&apos;d like to know about them, so I can hopefully further improve the software. But you should be careful to back up your existing data before using it with Notenik (and during, of course).  </p>
<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>If you run into any problems with any of this, or have any suggestions for further improvements, please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:support@notenik.net">support at notenik.net</a> and I&apos;ll see what I can do to help. </p>

	  	<p>People have been storing notes in text files long before Notenik came along. </p>
<p>At their most basic, such a note might consist simply of a chunk of text, with the file name serving as the note&apos;s title. </p>
<p>A slightly more sophisticated approach would be to use <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> to format a note, with a level 1 heading at the top of the file supplying a title for the note. </p>
<p>The use of <a href="https://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/metadata.html">MultiMarkdown metadata</a> adds even more possibilities, allowing multiple keys and associated values to be specified at the top of a file. </p>
<p>Although Notenik will read and respect all of these different sorts of text files, its own native format is a bit different from any of these. An example follows: </p>
<pre>
<code>Title: The Thinking Behind the Notenik File Format

</code></pre>
<pre>
<code>At their most basic, such a note might consist simply of a chunk of text, with the file name serving as the note&amp;apos;s title.
</code></pre>
<p>The Notenik format is very similar to the MultiMarkdown metadata format, but differs in that an explicit Body label is expected to indicate the start of the Note&apos;s body, rather than the body being assumed to start after the first blank line, or three hyphens, or four periods. </p>
<p>So why is the Notenik format different? </p>
<p>The answer, in general, is that I wanted Notenik files to have a bit more flexibility than any of these other formats, without sacrificing any of their simplicity or readability. </p>
<p>So whereas these other formats are primarily for documents, with at most some ability to supply metadata describing the docs, a Notenik file is an object consisting of a number of fields, with one or more of those fields containing text formatted using Markdown. </p>
<p>That being said, a Notenik file is not a completely general-purpose object: it&apos;s not intended to compete with JSON, for example. For one thing, each note must have a Title field and a Body field, in addition to other fields. Also, each field generally consists of a single value, without any convention for handling arbitrary lists, or any nesting of objects. </p>
<p>So there you have it: a Notenik Note sits somewhere between a Markdown doc with metadata and a full-fledged  object with any number of complex fields. Which makes it simple enough to be read and written by ordinary humans using any text editor, and yet flexible enough to help such users keep track of any number of useful, everyday objects. </p>
<p>Which was exactly my intent when concocting this format. </p>

	  	<![CDATA[
	  	<p>Version 2.6.0 was focused on strengthening support for opening folders full of existing text files and handling them smoothly as Notenik Collections. </p>
<p>This is especially important since Notenik introduces some important variations from any existing text file formats &#8211; notably the use of an explicit Body label preceding the main part of the note &#8211; and so users with existing collections of text-based notes are not likely to have formatted them to Notenik&apos;s standards, and are probably not interested in reformatting all of their Notes in order to allow Notenik to handle them sensibly. </p>
<p>Notenik now makes its best effort to recognize and appropriately handle the following variations on the normal Notenik format. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Markdown - The first line of the file contains a Markdown level 1 heading, which is to be used as the Note&apos;s title. The remainder of the file makes up the body. No metadata, and no field labels. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MultiMarkdown Metadata - The file may start with metadata, including a title, but there is no explicit label identifying the start of the body; instead, the first blank line indicates the end of the metadata and the start of the body. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plain Text - The title is taken from the file name, and the entire contents of the file makes up the body. No metadata, and no field labels.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Notenik will generally be able to determine which of these variations is being used based on the contents of the first few lines of the text file. </p>
<p>Notenik will also attempt to respect these variations when modifying an existing Note, keeping each Note in its original format. </p>
<p>A date parsing enhancement was also added, so that dates formatted as yyyymmdd, without any punctuation, will be correctly parsed. </p>
<p>The spelling checker was enabled for the Body text in 2.5.0. </p>
<p>This earlier release also added the ability to reload a Note from disk, which can be useful after using the Text Edit command to invoke an external text editor. </p>
<p>JSON export and sharing options were also added. </p>
<p>And, last but not least, a few additional bugs were corrected. </p>

	  	<p>Most of the changes for this release were focused on providing the capability for wiki-like inter-note linking. In order for this to work, you first have to check the Collection Preferences box titled &quot;Double Bracket Parsing for Inter-Note Links&quot;. Then, within the body of any of your notes, you can include a link to another Note in the same Collection by enclosing the Title of the target note within double square brackets. Then, when you click on the resulting link on the Display tab, you will be taken to the Note you have linked to. Click on the back arrow in the Toolbar to be taken back to the linking Note. </p>
<p>A new variable modifier of &apos;W&apos; was also added to the Template processing logic, which will enable the user to convert the inter-note links to appropriate anchor tags when generating HTML. </p>
<p>One additional, unrelated change was made to reset the user&apos;s preferences on the first launch after a prior crash on launch. </p>

	  	<![CDATA[
	  	<p>A few more fixes and improvements… </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Modified treatment of the Teaser field to treat it as a long text field. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added an optional Timestamp field which will create a series of digits representing the year, month, day, hour, minute and second on which the Note was created. This can be used as a fixed ID for each note, in line with the concept of a <em>Zettelkasten</em>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased the tolerance for parsing Notes that use a Markdown level 1 header to identify the Note&apos;s title. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a second Markdown parser, Ink, which can be used as an alternative to Down. </p>
</li>
</ul>
