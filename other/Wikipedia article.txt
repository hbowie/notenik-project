'''Notenik''' is the name of a free [[notetaking]] application for [[Mac OS X]]. 

Notenik stores each note in its own [[Text file]]. Notenik can be used to maintain multiple collections of notes, with each collection stored in its own [[Directory (computing)|folder]]. The user has full control over the placement of each folder. 

One or more [[Tag (metadata)|tags]] may be assigned to each note. Each tag may have multiple levels. Tags are stored internally within each note's text file. The application offers a view of a collection in which notes are presented in a [[Tree structure]].

Each note contains multiple [[Field (computer science)|fields]], always including a title and a body. Each collection may then be tailored to add other fields for notes contained within that collection. 

The body of each note may be formatted using [[Markdown]].

A note collection may be exported into a [[Comma-separated values]] file or a [[Tab-separated values]] file. 

Notenik has its own [[Template processor]] that can be used to format notes into [[HTML]] or any other text-based format. 

Notenik also has its own [[Scripting language]] that can be used to read a source collection, filter the data, sort the data, and then output the data using one or more formatting templates.
