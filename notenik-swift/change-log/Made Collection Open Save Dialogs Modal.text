Title:  Made Collection Open/Save Dialogs Modal

Seq:    3.8.0

Date:   19 May 2020

Body: 

When creating a new Collection, or opening an existing one, the screens presented are now modal, which means that they must be dealt with by the user before going back to another screen. This should prevent some common errors from occurring that sometimes resulted when the user ended up going back to the wrong screen before completing a New/Open operation.
