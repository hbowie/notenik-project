Title:  Added Double-Click Actions to the Tags Tab

Seq:    4.0.0

Date:   10 Jun 2020

Body: 

Double-clicking on a row in the Tags tab will now cause one of two actions:

* If you're double-clicking on a tag, then double-clicking will expand or collapse it;
* If you're double-clicking on a Note, then double-clicking will attempt to launch whatever is in the Link field for the Note, just as double-clicking does on the List tab.
