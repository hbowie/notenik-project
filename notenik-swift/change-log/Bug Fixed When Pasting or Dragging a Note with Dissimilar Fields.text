Title:  Bug Fixed When Pasting or Dragging a Note with Dissimilar Fields

Seq:    3.6.0

Date:   01 May 2020

Body: 

When pasting a copied Note into a Collection, if the Note to be copied had fields not already in the target Collection, then the paste would fail and the app would crash. 

Dragging and dropping a Note from one Collection to another would cause a similar situation. 

This has been fixed so that additional fields not present in the target Collection will be ignored.
