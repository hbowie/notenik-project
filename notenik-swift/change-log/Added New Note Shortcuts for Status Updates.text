Title:  Added New Note Shortcuts for Status Updates

Seq:    3.4.0

Date:   08 Apr 2020

Body: 

See these new commands beneath the Note menu:

* Toggle Status - Switches from least complete to most, and back again. 
* Increment Status - Bump to the next stage in the Collection's lifecycle. 

There are keyboard shortcuts available for both of these. 

Note that these are designed to be used in Display mode, not in Edit mode.
