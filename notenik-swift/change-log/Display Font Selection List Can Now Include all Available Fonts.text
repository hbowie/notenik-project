Title:  Display Font Selection List Can Now Include all Available Fonts

Seq:    4.8.0

Date:   10 Nov 2020

Body: 

A checkbox has been added to the Display Fonts window that, when checked, will result in the list of available fonts being expanded to include all font families available on the user's Mac. If unchecked, the user will only be able to select from a relatively short list of common fonts. 

This should close Issue # 38.
