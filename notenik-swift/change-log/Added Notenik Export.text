Title:  Added Notenik Export

Seq:    2.7.0

Date:   10 Jan 2020

Body: 

Added an option to export a Collection to a new Notenik Collection; this is intended to be especially useful when opening an existing folder full of text files, not necessarily in the usual Notenik file format, and then exporting them to a new Collection in which the Notenik format is fully normalized.
