Title:  Modified to allow URLs linking to files

Seq:    5.0.0

Date:   07 Dec 2020

Body: 

URLs starting with 'file:' should now be recognized as valid URLs. 

However, permissions issues may still prevent such links from being usefully resolved, if they link outside of the sandbox to a file for which the app does not have access privileges. 

This should resolve Issue # 42.
