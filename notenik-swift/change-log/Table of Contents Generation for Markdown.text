Title:  Table of Contents Generation for Markdown

Seq:    4.0.0

Date:   05 Jun 2020

Body: 

Adding a line containing only '[toc]' within the body field will now cause that line to be replaced by a table of contents containing links to all of the headings following the '[toc]' line. This will only happen if you have chosen to use the Notenik Markdown parser in the Notenik preferences.
