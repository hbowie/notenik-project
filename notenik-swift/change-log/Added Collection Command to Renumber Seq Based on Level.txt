Title:  Added Collection Command to Renumber Seq Based on Level

Seq:    6.3.0

Date:   06 Jun 2021

Body: 

Now that we have a Level field, we can combine Level with Seq to create an outline structure, and then, with this change, can automatically renumber the Seq fields in a Collection to reflect that outline structure.
