Title:  Updates to Work List Field Type

Seq:    6.3.0

Date:   02 Jun 2021

Body: 

I added 'Podcast' as another choice, when specifying the type of work being referenced or quoted. 

I also modified the logic so that you can use either a leading lower-case letter, or leading upper-case, when entering a work type value. Whichever one is used, and chosen, the value stored will be with leading upper-case.
