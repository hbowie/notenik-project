Title:  Additional Support for Link field variants

Seq:    4.0.0

Date:   05 Jun 2020

Body: 

Any field whose label contains the word 'link' will now be treated as a Link field, and will be shown as a clickable link on the Display tab. Additionally, if a Note does not have a simple 'Link' field, then launching the Note's link, or double-clicking on the Note, will cause the first non-blank link field on the Note to be used.
