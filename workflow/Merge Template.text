Body: 

The documentation for the overall merge template file spec is stored in its own Collection, as a sub-folder within the overall Notenik documentation.

After making any appropriate updates, run the reports available within the Collection. This will create/replace the 'merge-template.html' file within the top level of the Notenik documentation.
